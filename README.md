Molecular representation evaluation is all you need
We evaluated 25 types of representation methods on 17 benchmark datasets. Unifined score is used as our evaluation index. The overall evaluation results are as follows: Figure 1 shows the results of each representation on each dataset and Figure 2 shows the overall evaluation of each representation based on the results on each dataset.
