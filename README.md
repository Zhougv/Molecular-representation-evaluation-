Molecular representation evaluation is all you need
We evaluated 25 types of representation methods on 17 benchmark datasets. Unifined score is used as our evaluation index. The overall evaluation results are as follows: Figure 1 shows the results of each representation on each dataset and Figure 2 shows the overall evaluation of each representation based on the results on each dataset.

The 17 data sets evaluated can be found in the dataset directory. For the 12 fingerprint codes in the representation method and the code of the machine learning algorithm you can find in the ML&fingerprint directory. We provide github links to 13 deep learn-based representations. We made simple modifications to it to accommodate predictions for different tasks.
